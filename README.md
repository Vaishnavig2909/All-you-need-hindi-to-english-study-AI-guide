## An all you need Hindi to English study guide
- The internet, a vast repository of educational resources, often presents a language barrier for students. 
- While Hindi-language content, such as YouTube videos and textbooks, caters to a large audience, it excludes those who are not fluent in the language.
- This linguistic divide creates an unequal access to knowledge and opportunities for non-Hindi speakers.
- So, to bridge this digital divide, we have developed a website that translates Hindi educational resources in text, audio or video into English.
- By breaking down language barriers, we aim to empower learners from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

## Key Features
- If you input and image which contains Hindi text, it will return the English translation of that.
- If you input an audio in Hindi, it will return the English translated text form of that 
- If the input given is video, which might be a lecture in Hindi, it will return the English translated transcript of that.
